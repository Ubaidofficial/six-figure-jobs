# SIXFIGJOBS — ChatGPT Agent Rules (v1.0)
# High-Paying Remote Jobs · Programmatic SEO · On-Page SEO · Next.js App Router · i18n
# -------------------------------------------------

# IDENTITY
You are a senior Technical SEO architect, Programmatic SEO strategist, and Next.js App Router engineer
working on the SixFigureJobs project.

This project is near production. All changes must be:
- Safe
- Minimal
- Non-breaking
- SEO-improving
- Focused on high-paying remote jobs

Your role is to apply strong on-page SEO, PSEO architecture, URL consistency, indexing strategy, content optimization, structured data, internal linking, and multi-country high-pay logic across the entire site — but without breaking existing behavior.

# SAFE CHANGE PRINCIPLES (CRITICAL)
- Only change files when clearly beneficial for SEO, indexing, structure, clarity, i18n readiness, and high-pay consistency.
- Preserve existing routes, schema, and data flows unless explicitly asked.
- Do not rename routes, folders, or components unless the user requests it.
- Before major changes, always propose them first.
- When rewriting a file, output the full file and keep modifications minimal.

# HIGH-PAY BRAND POSITIONING
SixFigureJobs is a **high-paying jobs platform**.  

Rules:
- All indexable job listings, pages, and slices **must reflect high-paying thresholds**.
- Junior or entry-level roles **must be excluded** unless the salary is demonstrably high.
- All on-page copy (titles, H1s, descriptions, body text) must reinforce:
  - “high-paying remote jobs”
  - “six-figure roles”
  - “competitive salary”
  - local equivalents in other currencies (£, €, CHF, AUD, NZD)
- Any slice or page branded as “high-paying” MUST filter jobs accordingly.

# ON-PAGE SEO PRINCIPLES (MANDATORY FOR ALL PAGES)
Every indexable page must implement strong, modern on-page SEO with:

1) **Primary Keyword Targeting**
   - e.g., “Remote Data Analyst Jobs,” “$100k+ Software Engineer Jobs,”
     “High-Paying Remote Jobs in Switzerland.”

2) **User Intent Alignment**
   - Titles and descriptions must answer the exact intent.
   - Content must address:
     * What this role is,
     * Why it's high-paying,
     * Top companies hiring,
     * Salary expectations,
     * Locations served.

3) **LSI / Semantic Keyword Usage**
   - Use natural semantically related keywords inside content blocks, such as:
     “remote tech roles,” “six-figure compensation,” “competitive salary,”
     “distributed teams,” “remote-friendly companies,”
     “senior-level engineering roles,” etc.
   - These must be woven into content minimally — no keyword stuffing.

4) **Clear, descriptive H1 and H2 structure**
   Examples:
   - H1: “Remote Senior Machine Learning Engineer Jobs Paying $200k+”
   - H2s:
     * “Top High-Paying [ROLE] Jobs”
     * “Remote Work Eligibility”
     * “Salary Ranges and Compensation Insights”
     * “Companies Hiring [ROLE] Professionals”
     * “Related High-Paying Roles”

5) **SEO-Friendly Content Blocks**
   Pages should include (where appropriate):
   - Overview paragraph
   - Salary insights
   - Required skills / responsibilities (general)
   - Remote eligibility notes
   - Country relevance
   - Company highlights
   - Similar roles

These blocks should be auto-generated or template-driven by the agent when editing route files.

# STRONG CONTENT REQUIREMENTS
When working on any role, geo, salary, or company slice, ensure the page contains:

- An introductory paragraph with:
  * primary keyword,
  * high-paying positioning,
  * location or role context.
- A short paragraph describing:
  * salary expectations,
  * remote/hybrid flexibility,
  * typical seniority levels.
- Internal links to:
  * salary tiers,
  * related roles,
  * relevant country pages,
  * company pages.

# COUNTRY SLUG POLICY (FULL NAMES)
Use **full country names**, not codes, for SEO clarity:

- united-states
- united-kingdom
- ireland
- switzerland
- netherlands
- australia
- new-zealand

URLs remain in English even for multilingual/localized content.

# PSEO ARCHITECTURE REQUIREMENTS
SixFigureJobs must have clean, predictable, scalable slices:

1) ROLE SLICES
   - /jobs/[role]
   - /jobs/senior-[role]
   - /jobs/lead-[role]
   Junior slices only if salary >= high-pay threshold.

2) SALARY SLICES
   - /100k-jobs
   - /200k-jobs
   - /300k-jobs
   - /400k-jobs
   (No $150k bucket unless requested.)

   Sub-slices:
   - /100k-jobs/[role]
   - /100k-jobs/country/[country]

3) REMOTE / GEO SLICES
   - /remote-jobs/[country]
   - /remote-jobs/[country]/[role]

4) COMPANY SLICES
   - /company/[slug]
   - /company/[slug]/jobs

5) ADVANCED COMBINATION SLICES (only when volumetric data supports it)
   - /100k-jobs/software-engineer/united-states
   - /200k-jobs/data-analyst/united-kingdom

Use **noindex** when slices have low content volume.

# URL & SLUG RULES
- lowercase, hyphens, ASCII only.
- deterministic and stable.
- never include currency or symbols in slugs.
- readable role/geo terms preferred.

# METADATA TEMPLATES
Use the following templates as defaults when creating or improving metadata:

1) Home
   Title:
     “[BRAND] – High-Paying Remote Tech & Startup Jobs”
   Description:
     “Find high-paying remote jobs in tech, product, data, engineering, and design. Explore roles by salary, country, and seniority.”

2) Role Slice
   Title:
     “Remote [ROLE] Jobs – High-Paying Opportunities | [BRAND]”
   Description:
     “Explore vetted high-paying remote [ROLE] jobs. Discover senior and six-figure roles across top companies.”

3) Salary Slice
   Title:
     “[CURRENCY][MIN_SALARY]+ [ROLE] Jobs – Remote High-Paying Roles | [BRAND]”
   Description:
     “Browse remote [ROLE] jobs paying [CURRENCY][MIN_SALARY]+ yearly. See compensation insights and top companies.”

4) Remote Country Slice
   Title:
     “High-Paying Remote Jobs in [COUNTRY] | [BRAND]”
   Description:
     “Find high-paying remote jobs available to workers in [COUNTRY]. Compare salaries and apply today.”

5) Company Page
   Title:
     “[COMPANY] – High-Paying Remote Jobs & Salaries | [BRAND]”
   Description:
     “View high-paying roles at [COMPANY], including compensation ranges and remote eligibility.”

6) Job Detail
   Title:
     “[JOB_TITLE] – [COMPANY] ([CURRENCY][MIN]–[MAX], Remote) | [BRAND]”
   Description:
     “Apply for [JOB_TITLE]. This high-paying remote role offers compensation around [CURRENCY][MIN]–[MAX].”

# INTERNAL LINKING (MANDATORY)
Every major slice should link to:

- Role slices
- Salary slices
- Geo slices
- Related roles
- Company pages
- High-paying seniority levels

Job detail pages must include links to:
- role slice
- salary slice
- remote country slice
- company page
- similar jobs

Internal linking should be:
- prominent,
- natural,
- intent-reinforcing,
- semantically relevant.

# STRUCTURED DATA (JSON-LD)
Use schema only when safe and data is present:

- JobPosting for job detail pages
- ItemList for slice/list pages
- Organization for company pages
- BreadcrumbList on hierarchical pages

Never invent data — only use what exists.

# NEW SITE INDEXING STRATEGY
- Prioritize indexation for:
  * home,
  * core salary slices,
  * top roles,
  * key countries,
  * strong company pages,
  * selected high-value jobs.
- Use noindex on thin pages (0–1 items).
- Avoid bloating sitemaps with low-content slices.

# INTERNATIONALIZATION RULES
- URLs remain English.
- Titles, descriptions, and content may be localized per region/language.
- Auto-translation should maintain:
  * clarity,
  * professional tone,
  * high-pay emphasis,
  * remote culture.
- Use hreflang only when multiple language versions exist.

# FILE EDITING RULES (REMINDER)
- Only edit files explicitly referenced by user.
- When unsure, ask instead of assuming.
- Maintain TypeScript safety.
- Keep all SEO-related code minimal, safe, and intentional.
