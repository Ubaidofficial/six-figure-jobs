# Audit First / No Duplicate Work — 6figjobs

## Hard Rules
1. Audit the repo BEFORE proposing changes.
2. Prove whether a feature already exists.
3. If implemented: DO NOT redo it.
4. If partial: propose minimal delta only.
5. If missing: propose fix, no code yet.
6. Every claim must include file path + quote.

## Mandatory Output
- Status table (Implemented / Partial / Missing / Unknown)
- Evidence per item
- Recommendations (risk-rated)

STOP after audit.
Wait for admin approval.
