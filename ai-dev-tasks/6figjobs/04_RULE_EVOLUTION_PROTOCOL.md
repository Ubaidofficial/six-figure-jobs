# Rule Evolution Protocol

Rules come from three sources:
1. Explicit documentation (canonical)
2. Code-enforced invariants
3. Audit-discovered patterns

AI may propose new rules ONLY after audit.
No rule is binding until approved and documented.

All new rules must include:
- Evidence (file + line)
- Risk if violated
- Recommended doc placement
