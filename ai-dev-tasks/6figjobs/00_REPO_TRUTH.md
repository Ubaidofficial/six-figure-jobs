# Repo Truth — 6figjobs

## Rule
Do NOT assume anything about the codebase.
All claims must be backed by file paths and quotes.

## Verified Root Structure
- app/
- components/
- lib/
- scripts/
- prisma/
- docs/

## Non-negotiables
- Canonical URLs only
- No index bloat
- Stable slugs
- Data correctness > volume
- Audit before change

If a file is not present, mark:
UNKNOWN — NOT IN REPO
