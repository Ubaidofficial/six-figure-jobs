# Competitor Audit + Enrichment Protocol — 6figjobs

Purpose: convert competitor observations into safe, evidence-based enrichment tasks.

## Rule
Competitor features are inputs, not requirements.
No implementation without:
- repo audit evidence (feature not already present)
- PRD + approval

## What to collect per competitor
- URL examples (3–10)
- Feature description (what user sees)
- SEO angle (why it might rank)
- Data angle (what fields are enriched)
- Implementation guess (marked as hypothesis)

## Output format
1) Opportunity list (ranked by impact)
2) Mapping to our code areas:
   - app/ routes
   - lib/seo/
   - lib/slices/
   - lib/scrapers/
   - prisma schema changes (if needed)
3) PRDs for top items only (separate PRDs)
